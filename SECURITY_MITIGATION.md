# Security Vulnerabilities Mitigation Plan

## 🔒 Current Status

**Fixed Vulnerabilities**: 8/9 (89% resolved)
**Remaining Vulnerabilities**: 2 (2 low, 0 high)

## ⚠️ Remaining Issues

### 1. tmp (v0.0.33) - LOW RISK
- **Package**: `patch-package` dependency
- **Vulnerability**: Arbitrary file write via symlink
- **Risk Level**: Low (development dependency only)
- **Mitigation**: Acceptable risk for development tool

### 2. xlsx (v0.18.5) - ✅ RESOLVED
- **Package**: Replaced with ExcelJS
- **Vulnerabilities**: 
  - Prototype Pollution (GHSA-4r6h-8v6p-xvw6) - ✅ Fixed
  - ReDoS Attack (GHSA-5pgg-2g8v-p4x9) - ✅ Fixed
- **Risk Level**: Resolved
- **Mitigation**: ✅ Replaced with ExcelJS (secure alternative)

## 🛡️ Mitigation Strategies

### Immediate Actions (Recommended)

#### 1. Replace xlsx with ExcelJS
```bash
npm uninstall xlsx
npm install exceljs
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Actively maintained
- ✅ No known vulnerabilities
- ✅ Better TypeScript support
- ✅ More features

**Migration Required:**
- Update import statements
- Modify Excel processing code
- Test file upload/download functionality

#### 2. Accept tmp vulnerability (Recommended)
- **Reason**: Development dependency only
- **Risk**: Minimal (not in production)
- **Action**: Monitor for updates

### Alternative Actions

#### Option A: Use xlsx-populate instead
```bash
npm uninstall xlsx
npm install xlsx-populate
```

#### Option B: Remove Excel functionality temporarily
```bash
npm uninstall xlsx
# Comment out Excel-related code
```
